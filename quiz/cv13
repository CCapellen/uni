Q: What are motion fields?
A: "The motion field is the projection of the 3D scene motion into the image" The motion field of the image: The components of the 3D motion projected onto the image: v_x=dx/dt, v_y=dy/dt
Q: What is optical flow?
A: the apparent motion of brightness patterns in the image
Q: Name the brightness constancy equation
A: I(x,y,t-1) = I(x+u(x,y),y+v(x,y),t)
Q: What can be derived from the brightness constancy equation and what does it mean intuitively?
A:expanding the right side of the equation you get that I_x*u + I_y*v + I_t = 0. You cannot determine the component of the flow which is parallel to the edge
Q: What is the aperture problem?
A: You cannot determine the component of the flow which is parallel to the edge. if you look at only small parts of an image you are likely to only see one edge too. (you want to get the optical flow, but the equation has two unknowns -> you need another constraint?)
Q: What is the spatial coherence constraint?
A: pretend the pixel's neighbors have the same (u,v) -> now too many equations -> solve least square problem; (which is not always solvable
Q: What conditions for solvability are there for least square problem in the context of the spatial coherence constraint.
A: If all the examples (rows) are dependent - might happen with single straight edge (?) - you can see it the the eigenvalues of the second moment matrix
Q: What is the Lucas-Kanade flow? 
A: It is a method for estimating the optical flow (of two images?). It uses the spatial coherence constraint: It assumes that inside a window of given size the optical flow equation holds and solves this equation (in matrix form: Av=b by the least squares principle: v=(A^T*A)^-1*A^T*b
Q: What problems are there with the Lucas-Kanade flow?
A: the diferential equation only holds for vert small motion (often less than a pixel), ...(slide 30)
Q: Describe the Shi-Tomasi feature tracker
A: Find features whose motion can be estimated reliability. From frame to frame track with Lucas-Kanade. Check consitency of tracks by affine registration to the first observed instance of the feature
Q: Describe the Horn-Schunk model
A: Works with energy functional E(u,v)= /integral_{/Omega} (I_x*u+I_y*v + I_t)^2 + /alpha*(|/triangle u|^2 + |/triangle v|^2) consisting of the brightness constancy equation and the assumtion that the optic flow field is smooth (|/triangle u|^2 + |/triangle v|^2 /rightarrow min
