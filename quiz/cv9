Q: From which parts consists a typical model for temporal estimation/tracking?
A: Measurement model + temporal model
Q: What is a temporal model?
A: describes the realtionship between states w_t
Q: What is a measurement model?
A: describes the reationship between measurement x_t and state w_t at time t. It is a generative model and models Pr(x_t,w_t). We assume that x_t is only dependend on w_t and conditionally independent of w_i for i != t.
Q: What is a generative model?
A: A model which models the probability of data given a state. (is this correct?)
Q: What does The Markov Asumption assume?
A: The state only depends on its predecessor.
Q: How can you model the temporal model with a recursive estimation?
A: You can estimate the world states though two alternating seps: In the prediction step, we compute the propr Pr(w_t|x_{1...t-1) using the Chapman-Kolmogorov relation. In the measurement incorporation step we combine his propr with the newinformatino from the measurement x_t using Bayes's rule.
Q: What is the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation?
A: The probability of the world state at time t given the data at all times up to t-1: Pr(w_t|x_{1...t-1}) = \integral Pr(w_t,w_t-1)Pr(w_{t-1}|x_{1...t-1})dw_{t-1}. The first term represents the prediction for the state at time t given a known state. The second term represents the uncertainty about what the state actually was at time t-1.
