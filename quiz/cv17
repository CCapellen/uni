Q: what is disparity?
A: from two viewpoints objects are seen from different visual angles, when viewers fixate on the same object
Q: What are random dot stereograms
A: pair of synthetic images obtained by randomly spraying black dots on white objects; used to se if we identify local brightness patterns before fusion (monocular process) or after (binocular)
Q: Describe the basic stereo matching algorithm
A: For each pixel in the first image – Find corresponding epipolar line in the right image – Examine all pixels on the epipolar line and pick the best match – Triangulate the matches to get depth information
Q: When are the epipolar lines scanlines? 
A: when the images planes are parallel, the center at the same height and the focal lenghts the same
Q: What is the essential matrix?
A:
Q: How can you get the depth from the disparity?
A:
