Q: What is out-of-sample testing and random subsamling?
A: split in train and test set, can be further improved by repeating the process and averaging (random subsampling)
Q: What is true error, sample error?
A:
Q: what are bias and variance of estimators?
A: Bias = E[error_S(h)] - error_D(h), Variance error of certain samples variate from expected error
Q: What are confindence intervals?
A: for and unbiased estimator you want to bound the true error based on the sample error. you can do this with a certain confidence N for an interval around the sample error. The size of the interval depends on N, the sample error and the sample size
Q: What is the binomial distrubtion. What does it model?
A: (n over r) p^r * (1-p)^(n-r). Model probability of r wins in n binary experiments where chance of winning is p
Q: calculate for the binomial distribution the expected value, the variance and the standard deviation
A: slide 16
