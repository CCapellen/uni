Q: What are the main ideas behind CNNs? Why are they used? (What advantages do they have?)
A: local receptive fields, parameter sharing, equivariant representations and subsampling. because of the convolution, CNNs can deal with input of different size.
Q: What is subsampling?
A:
Q: What is equivariance? When is it useful/not useful?
A: A equivariant function: for change in input, output changes the same way; Translation equivariance: applying convolution before or after remapping (change of pixel location) has same result.
