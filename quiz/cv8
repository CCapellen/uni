Q: What is a grab cut?
A: An interactive segmentation technique (only into forground and background): The user loosely specifies the foreground region and then an iterative graph cut is applied.
Q: What is a mixture of Gaussians (MoG)?
A: The data is described as a weighted sum of K normal distributions. The weights have to be positive and sum to one.
Q: What is the idea behind hidden variables?
A: It might be easier to express the density of some variable x by representing it as the marginalization of a joint density with a hidden variable h. 
Q: What is the relation between Mixture of Gaussians as a marginalization and hidden Variables?
A:
Q: Describe the Expectation maximization algorithm.
A:
Q: How does expectation maximization work in general?
A:
Q: What does Jensen's Inequality say?
A:
Q: What is background subtraction
A: An algorithm which tries to label every pixel binary into forground and background
