Q: Describe/paint the pinhole camera model in the normalized coordinate system
A: camera center C is at the origin and the principal axis is the z-axis. Point where the principal axis intersects the image plane: principal point P (origin of normalized coordinate system??! the slides are not consistent) Between C and P is distance f.
Q: What is the image coordinate system and how can you convert between this and the normalized one?
A: in the image coordinate system the origin is in the corner/ You can convert by a translation
Q: What is the calibration matrix
A: the matrix to convert between normalized coord-sys. and image coord-sys.
Q: How can you convert from camera coordinate system to image coordinate system?
A:
Q: How can you convert from world coordinates to camera coordinates?
A: by translation and rotation: slide 16
Q: What are the intrinsic parameters of a camera?
A: the principal point coordinates, the focal length and the pixel magnification factors (m_x pixels per meter in horizotal direction, m_y ""), also: the skew and the radial distortion
Q: What does linear distortion look like in an image?
A: slide 18
Q: What extrinsic camera parameters are there?
A: the rotation and translation relative to the world coordinates
Q: Describe the task of camera calibration
A: estimating the camera parameters (extrinsic and intrinsic) given n points with known 3D coordinates
Q: How can you estimate camera calibration using the linear method?
A:
